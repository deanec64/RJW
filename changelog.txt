-other bugfixs

	- Fuckers generally need to have a penis to rape. However, CP raping and random raping can allow the fucker to be non-futa woemn with vulnerability not larger than a value you can set in the setting. 
	- For the CP raping, non-futa women need to have traits like rapist or nymphomaniac.
	- Randomly generated women won't have necrophiliac and zoophiliac traits.
	- You can add penis to women to make futas through surgeries.
	- Pawns who have love partners won't fuck CP
	- Completed the whore system(Pawns who are assigned whorebeds will be the whores, they'll try to hookup with those in need of sex. 
If visitors are from other factions, they will pay a price to the whore after sex. The price is determined based on many details of the whore.)
	- Completed behaviors for necrophiliac
	- Some code optimization
	- Added rotting to the private parts by SuperHotSausage

Here's an overview about the behaviors introduced by RJW(with default setting):
There are 3 types of rapes(i.e. can beat targets) in RJW:
a)Random rape ( applied to penis-owned rapists or non-futa female rapists with vulnerability <= NonFutaWomenRaping_MaxVulnerability)
Targets: small and decile animals(only with zoophiliac trait) with vulnerability >=Rapee_MinVulnerability_animals, human with vulnerability >=Rapee_MinVulnerability_human
b)CP rape (applied to player's penis-owned colonists, male animals, and non futa-female rapists or nymphos with vulnerability <= NonFutaWomenRaping_MaxVulnerability)
Targets:The pawns you designated as comfort prisoners.
c)Corpse rape (applied to penis-owned necrophiliacs)
Targets:Corpse

There is 3 types of loving in RJW:
a)Nymph-join-bed lovin(applied to genitals-owned horny nymphos)
Targets:horny people laying in the bed
b)Whores service(applied to player's genitals-owned whores)
Targets: Priority gives to the guest caravans, then to your colonists. 
c)Zoophiliac lovin (applied to penis-owned zoophiliacs or non-futa female zoophiliacs with vulnerability <= NonFutaWomenRaping_MaxVulnerability)
Targets: normal-sized animals with vulnerability >=Rapee_MinVulnerability_animals
Note:non-skill factor of vulnerability is 0.9

Traits distribution is:
a)rapists:male 0.1, female :0.02
b)nymph:male 0.1, female 0.08
c)necro:male 0.05, female 0
d)zooph:male 0.03, female 0

v1.2 to v1.3:
  - Added breast and anus body parts, along with hydraulic/bionic alternatives
  - Added necrophilia
  - Added random rapes
  - Exposed more constants in configuration file

  - Enabled pregnancy for raped pawns via RimWorldChildren
  - Updated mod options

v1.0 to v1.1:
Added bondage gear
  - Implemented special apparel type which applies a HeDiff when it's equipped
  - Implemented locked apparel system which makes certain apparel unremovable except with a special "holokey" item
  - Implemented new ThingComp which attaches a unique hex ID & engraved name to items
  - Implemented more ThingComps which allow items to be used on prisoners (or in the case of apparel the item is equipped on the prisoner)
  - Finally with all the infrastructure done, added the actual bondage gear
    - Armbinder which prevents manipulation and any sort of verb casting
    - Gag which prevents talking and reduces eating
    - Chastity belt which prevents sex, masturbation, and operations on the genitals

Started using the Harmony library to patch methods
  - No longer need to override the Lovin' JobDef thanks to patches in JobDriver_Lovin.MakeNewToils and JobDriver.Cleanup. This should
    increase compatibility with other mods and hopefully will work smoothly and not blow up in my face.
  - Patched a bunch of methods to enable bondage gear
  - Created a custom build of Harmony because the regular one wasn't able to find libmono.so on my Linux system
Pawns (except w/ Bloodlust or Psychopath) are less likely to hit a prisoner they're raping if the prisoner is already in significant pain
Nymphs won't join-in-bed colonists who are in significant pain
STD balance changes
  - Infections won't pass between pawns unless the severity is at least 21%
  - Accelerated course of warts by 50% and syphilis by ~20%

  - Herpes is 33% more likely to appear on newly generated pawns
  - Pawns cannot be infected if they have any lingering immunity
  - Syphilis starts at 20% severity (but it isn't more dangerous since the other stats have been adjusted to compensate)
  - Syphilis can be cured if its severity is pushed below 1% even without immunity
STD defs are loaded from XML instead of hardcoded
Added some config options related to STDs
Sex need won't decline on pawns under age 15

The "Raped" debuff now stacks
Fixed incompatibilities with Prepare Carefully

    once the pawns appear on the map)
  - Fixed a crash that occured when PC tried to generate tooltips for bionic privates
Fixed derp-tier programming that boosted severity instead of immunity on opportunistic infections
Sex satisfaction now depends on the average of the two pawn's abilities instead of their product

Nymph join event baseChance reduced from 1.0 to 0.67 and minRefireDays increased from 2 to 6
